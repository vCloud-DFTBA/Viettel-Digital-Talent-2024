# Midterm assignment for VDT Cloud 2024

## I. Develop a simple 3-tier web application

### Requirements:

- #### Develop a web application with the following features :

  - Display a list of students in VDT2024 in a table with the following information: Full name, Gender, and School they are attending.

  - Allow viewing details, adding, deleting, and updating student information.

- ### Design web application:

  - Web Interface: **ReactJs** - Create flexible and responsive user interfaces.
  - API: **NodeJS** - Develop high-performance, easy-to-build and integrate RESTful APIs.
  - Database: **MySQL** - Flexible SQL database, scalable and capable of handling large volumes of data.

- ### Write Unit Tests for each API:

  - Use Jest and Supertest to test NodeJS api.

- ### Output :
  - vdt2024-web source code: [here](https://github.com/DI-huyentm/VDT_FE)
  - vdt2024-api source code: [here](https://github.com/DI-huyentm/VDT_BE)
  - unit-test source code: [here](https://github.com/DI-huyentm/VDT_BE/tree/main/test)
  - Demo web application:
    - `List of VDT2024 Cloud students`:
      <img src= images/view.png>
    - `Detele student from the list`:
      <img src= images/delete.png>
    - `Add student to the list`:
      <img src= images/add.png>
      <img src= images/add-02.png>
    - `Modify student infomation`:
      <img src= images/edit.png>
  - Output Unit Test:
    <img src= images/unit-test-pass.png>

## II. Triển khai web application sử dụng các DevOps tools & practices

### 1. Containerization

Requirements:

- Write a Dockerfile for each repository to package the services into container images.
- The image should ensure optimized build time and minimal disk space usage, utilizing recommended image building techniques (layer-caching, optimized RUN instructions, multi-stage build, etc.)

Output:

- Dockerfile for each service in the three-service system:

  - **api** : Here is Dockerfile with optimized techniques used:

  ```
  # Use Node 22 slim base image for a lightweight starting point
  FROM node:22-slim

  WORKDIR /app

  COPY package*.json ./

  RUN npm install

  COPY . .

  EXPOSE 3001

  CMD ["npm", "start"]

  ```

  - **web** : Here is Dockerfile with optimized techniques used:

  ```
    # Use Node 22 slim base image for a lightweight starting point
    FROM node:22-slim

    # Set the working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy the rest of the frontend files to the working directory
    COPY . .

    # Expose the port on which the React development server will run
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Command to run the React development server
    CMD ["npm", "start"]

  ```

  - **docker-compose** :[here](https://github.com/DI-huyentm/Compose-V1/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) . Here's a brief summary of the provided Docker Compose configuration:
    - Three services are defined: `frontend`, `backend`, and `mysql`.
    - `frontend` service:
      - Builds the frontend container.
      - Maps port 3000 of the host to port 3000 of the container.
      - Depends on the `backend` service.
    - `backend` service:
      - Builds the API container.
      - Maps port 3001 of the host to port 3001 of the container.
      - Depends on the `mysql` service.
    - `mysql` service:
      - Uses the mysql:5.7 image.
      - Maps port 3306 of the host to port 3306 of the container.
      - Initializes a database named vdt.
    - service `mysql` and service `backend` use **healthcheck** to ensure that service `backend` only run after `mysql` has already run.

- Build command:

```
docker compose up --build
```

- Docker history information of each image:
  `frontend`

```
docker-compose build frontend
```

<img src= images/build_img_fe.png>

`backend`

```
docker-compose build backend
```

<img src= images/build_img_be.png>

### 2. Continuous Integration

Requirements:

- Automatically run unit test when creating a PR on the main branch.
- Automatically run unit tests when pushing a commit to a branch.

Output:

- CI tool setup file: [here](https://gitlab.com/DI-huyentm/VDT_BE/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Output log of CI stream:
  <img src= images/log-ci.png>
- Other demo images:

  - Automatically run unit test when creating a PR on the main branch
    <img src= images/merge-request-to-main.png>
    <img src= images/merge-request-to-main-02.png>

  - Automatically run unit tests when pushing a commit to a branch
    <img src= images/pull-request-to-a-branch.png>
    <img src= images/pull-request-to-a-branch-02.png>
    <img src= images/pull-request-to-a-branch-03.png>
